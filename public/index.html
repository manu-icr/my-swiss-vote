      <p>Welcome to the EPFL Extension School's course on UI Development with React.js. This course is designed to
        up-skill you in the realm of React.js, and more peripherally, ES6 JavaScript. As we work through the three
        course projects, we'll be covering everything from the basics of creating your own stateful components, to more
        advanced React development patterns.</p>

      <p>Swiss-Vote is the first of the three course projects. It's a basic React app that visualizes a data set of
        historical votes in Switzerland that was obtained through the Polis API, which is developed and maintained by
        SRG SSR, the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation.</p>

      <p>This project will be your introduction to stateless and stateful React components. We'll be exploring what
        props and state are, and how they are used to develop encapsulated components that can be composed together to
        make complex user-interfaces.</p>

      <p>In the box below, you'll see an interface, which is a React component. The purpose of this component is to
        render a map that can be colored according to the yes and no votes of a particular historical vote in
        Switzerland.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="demo">
      <div class="grain"></div>
      <div id="root"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="is-secondary">"Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make
        complex UIs."</h2>

      <p>The above quote comes from React's official documentation, and it will be the focal point for this course. To
        begin, let's have a quick look at what a component is, what state is, and what it means to compose components.</p>

      <h3>Components.</h3>

      <p>A component is a function that returns a React element. React elements can be rendered to the DOM via
        ReactDOM, a complementary library. But other renders exist too. For example, React Native a the renderer that
        you can use to build native mobile apps from React components. And there are custom renderers too. Video game
        studios even use custom renderers that enable them to build their gaming interfaces out of React components.</p>

      <p>Rendering a component to the DOM can look as simple as this the example below.</p>

      <pre><code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;SimpleDemo /&gt;,
  document.getElementById("pretty-simple")
);</code></pre>

      <p>The render above would insert the stateless component below into the DOM. I'll explain what "stateless means"
        in just a moment.</p>

      <h3>JSX.</h3>

      Just in case you're wondering about the "custom" tag, &lt;SimpleDemo /&gt;, inside of the render call; that
      syntax is JSX. Notice that the SimpleDemo begins with a capital letter; that's because it refers to a React
      component. JSX syntax simplifies the way that we reference components. It looks a lot like HTML or XML, and we'll
      explore it in greater depth as we work through the course.

      <h3>Functional components.</h3>

      <pre><code>function SimpleDemo() {
  return &lt;h3&gt;Isn't this easy?&lt;/h3&gt;;
}</code></pre>

      <p>That's it; the code blocks above would render an h3 header with the text "Isn't this easy?" where the element
        with the ID "pretty-simple" is. That's it; everything you need to render a component to the DOM.</p>

      <p>But React is pretty powerful, and stateless components like the one above only offer minimal functionality, so
        we'll be slowly adding-in more functionality on top of that basic pattern as we progress through the course.</p>

      <h3>Stateful components.</h3>

      If the example above is of a "stateless" React component, its "stateful" counterpart might look like this:

      <pre><code>class SimpleDemo extends React.Component {
  state = {
    message: "Isn't this easy?"
  }

  render() {
    return &lt;h3&gt;{this.state.message}&lt;/h3&gt;;
  }
}</code></pre>

      <p>The <i>stateful</i> component above would render the same exact element to the DOM as the <i>stateless</i>
        component above it. The difference, however, is that the stateful component can be "reactive", in the sense
        that if the "state" object updates, the component will re-render and will reflect the updated text.</p>

      <h3>Composing components together.</h3>

      <p>Let's look at a mock-up of the Swiss-Vote app that outlines the components that compose it. In it, you'll
        notice four colored boxes, which indicate the four different React components that make up the UI: <code>&lt;<span class="is-cursive is-primary">App</span>
          /&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;<span class="is-cursive is-tertiary">Selector</span> /&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;<span class="is-cursive is-secondary">Map</span>
          /&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;<span class="is-cursive is-quaternary">ResultsTable</span> /&gt;</code>.
        ResultsTable is a
        fallback table of the selected vote data set, and it is nested inside of the <code>&lt;canvas /&gt;</code>
        element that Map renders.
        In the mock-up, ResultsTable appears nested inside of Map, just as Map and Selector appear nested inside of
        App.</p>

      <img src="%PUBLIC_URL%/mock_up.jpeg" alt="Components mock up" />

      Before we begin working our way through the Swiss-Vote project, let's look briefly at what each of those four
      components does.

      <h3><code>&lt;<span class="is-cursive is-primary">App</span> /&gt;</code></h3>

      <p>This is the root component. It manages the state for <code class="is-tertiary">&lt;Selector /&gt;</code> and
        <code class="is-secondary">&lt;Map /&gt;</code>, and it renders
        those two components as well.</p>

      <h3><code>&lt;<span class="is-cursive is-secondary">Map</span> /&gt;</code></h3>

      <p>This component renders the image of the map of Switzerland. The image is a &lt;canvas /&gt; element that is
        rendered by <code class="is-secondary">&lt;Map /&gt;</code>, and Map also calls a function that draws the map
        on the canvas. We'll
        look at this in detail a little later in the course.</p>

      <h3><code>&lt;<span class="is-cursive is-tertiary">Selector</span> /&gt;</code></h3>

      <p>Selector renders the autocomplete field that lets filter the list of historical votes. We'll build this
        component in two stages: first as a simple drop-down &lt;select&gt;&lt;/select&gt;, and then later as the
        autocomplete field that you see on this page.</p>

      <h3><code>&lt;<span class="is-cursive is-quaternary">ResultsTable</span> /&gt;</code></h3>

      <p>Last, but not least, we have ResultsTable, which renders an HTML table element that contains the same data
        that
        is used to color the map of Switzerland. It's purpose is to be nested inside of <code class="is-secondary">&lt;Map /&gt;</code>
        as a fallback table for any person who is viewing the page from an accessibility device.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>Swiss-Vote is the vessel through which we'll explore our introduction to the React.js library. In this first
        part of the course, we'll get familliar with the following React features and patterns:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Stateless functional components</li>
        <li>Stateful class components</li>
        <li>Controlled components</li>
        <li>Render props</li>
      </ul>
